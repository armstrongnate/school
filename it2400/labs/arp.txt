Answer: FastEthernet0/6; Because it is a switch to switch connection.

3. Capture again and visit a different website, does the answer to the above question ever change? Why?

Answer: No because mac addresses are hard-coded.

4. Find the response from the above frame and identify the source mac and destination mac. (screenshot) 

Before you close wireshark, start a capture again and type ‘arp’ in the filter box. Now wireshark will only show you arp traffic. If you on your windows VM you should readily see some arp traffic. If you do not, issue the arp -d * command again, to delete all your arp entries and then visit a website again to generate some network traffic.
