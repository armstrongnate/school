DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BIT AND BYTE => bit is either a 1 or a 0, byte is 8 bits.

kbps vs kb => kbps is bits: measures speed. kb is bytes: measures memory.

* CHAPTER 1

How to convert between binary and decimal.

	2^0 = 1
	2^1 = 2
	2^2 = 4
	2^3 = 8
	2^4 = 16
	2^5 = 32
	2^6 = 64
	2^7 = 128

	break binary number into 4 digits at a time
		1011 0010
			start at right right most digit, it represents 2^0. Move left from there incrementing exponent.
			128 32 16 2
			add those up = 178

Convert binary to decimal
	138
		pick biggest number that you can subtract from binary number.
		in this case, 128
		do the subtraction. Repeat.
		
		138
		-128
		= 10
		 -8
		= 2
		- 2
		= 0
		so numbers are 2 8 128 which equals 1000 1010
	235
		binary = 1110 1011

Hexadecimal
	Uses #'s 0-9, A-F

* CHAPTER 2

The OSI Model
	1. Physical
		This is the foundation. 
		Deals with the 1's and 0's. 
		Fiber, copper, radio waves
	
	2. Data Link
		Where the 1's and 0's go. 
		Network Interface Card (NIC) **
			Two layers within this layer:
				- Media Access Control (MAC) **
					this is mac address: 48 bit address written in hexadecimal.
					hard coded onto the NIC on the circuit board.
				- Logical Link Control (LLC) **
		FRAME - framing takes place at this layer

	3. Network
		Start to see IP Addresses
	
	4. Transport
		TCP, UDP

	5. Session
		Sockets

	6. Presentation
		
	7. Application
		Highest level. Applications that we interact with. 
		Deals with layers 1-4 mostly.

THE DATA LINK LAYER
	Network Interface Card
		Where networking starts and ends. 
		Job: take what the computer is saying and convert it to 1's and 0's.
		Has a 48 bit MAC address (identified as PHYSICAL ADDRESS):
			looks something like this: 001A : 197E : 7731 : 9FCA
			the first 6 digits are the Organizational Unit Identifier (OUI) **
				represents manufacturer
			remaining digits are the Device ID.
		Job: Create frames.
			organizes 1's and 0's into chunks.
			puts headers on 1's and 0's to keep track of where it came from, where it's going, etc.
			One frame shown below
			-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			-						-						-					-					-
			-	Recipient MAC		-		Sender MAC		-		DATA		-		CRC			-
			-						-						-					-					-
			-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			One frame is on average 1500 bytes. If it's bigger the network card will defrag or bust?
			
	Hub
		Bad because it copies all input and sends it to every possible output.
	
	Ethernet
		Expected to have collisions. Use CSMA/CD (..Multiple Access/Collision Detection) to detect those collisions.

	Use broadcast addresses
		look like FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
		sending information to everybody
