* No Inheritance
* Main.main() is the first function invoked
* subroutines = functions, methods constructors
    * functions: class methods. ex: "function int sum(int n)"
* var = defining a variable
* let = making an assignment
* do = call a function, don't do anything with its return

* all comparison operators are single digit. No double ='s
* eq, lt, gt, and not are the only comparison operators.

* all fields and statics must be defined before subroutines are defined.
* static variables are class variables (available to all instances)

* constructor can be called anything. It just makes sense to all it 'new'
* "x = Name_of_Class.name_of_constructor(params)"

* all fields are private. You must write a method to access it. All methods are public.

* use dots ('.') not right arrows ('->')

* int = 16 bit signed value
* char = unicode character
* bool = 16 bit value
* all 0's is false, 1's is true

* "var Fraction a, b, c;" does not create 3 instances of Fraction class. It create 3 pointers.

* methods and functions must end with a 'return' statement

* 'this' refers to current object. Can only be accessed within method.

* accessing items in an array is tricky

  function int foo() {
    var Array people;
    var p Person;
    let people = Array.new(6);
    let people[3] = Person.new("Nate");
    let p = people[3];
    do p.printName();
  }
