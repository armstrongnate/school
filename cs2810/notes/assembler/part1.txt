Tables (or dictionaries) to write
	Make python dictionaries for each of the following:
		Destinations
			null = ''
		compuations	
			ALU (A's, D's, M's)
			First column, 1 in front.
			third column, 0 in front.
				ex:
					A+1 => 1110010
					M+1 => 0110010
			accounts for a through c6
		jumps
			jmp => 111
			..

		some of the tables will be found in previous chapters. 
		'The C-instruction revisited' slide.

Helper functions
	isSymbol: table in book with appropriate symbols
		return false if:
			empty string
			starts with a digit

	isConstant: 
		isdigit() # all digits
		len() is between 1 and 5
		convert to int() and make sure it's less than 32767

	fail
		print >>sys.stderr, "message"
		sys.exit(1)
		
Parsing a single line
	parseLine
		
File Handling
	use sys.exit(1) to kill program and exit. Remember to print error.

By Thursday night:
	run from command line
	point at assembly language file
	write parsed code to hack file
