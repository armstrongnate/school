Flags
	sf - sign
		set if most significant bit is 1
	zf - zero
		set if all bits are 0
	cf - carry
		set if there was a carry with the most significant bit
		cross boundary at top of circle?
	of - overflow
		related to 2's complement
		cross boundary at bottom of circle?

	How to use these flags to help us know when to jump?
		op		flags
		// 2's complement
		je		zf
		jne		!zf
		jg		!(sf ^ of) & !zf	
		jge		!(sf ^ of)
		jl		sf ^ of // if overflow, flip the sign.
		jle		(sf ^ of) | zf
		// unsigned	
		ja		!cf & !zf
		jae		!cf
		jb		cf
		jbe		cf | zf

		* ja => jump if above
		* jb => jump if below
		* ^ => exclusive or
