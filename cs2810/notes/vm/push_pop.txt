3 groupings of segment types
	1. constant
	2. static, pointer, temp
	3. arg, local, this, that

	i. view push constant commands in part1.txt
	ii. 
		static: 
			push static 3 =
				@Person.3
				D=M	
				.. repeat starting at @sp from push constant	
		pointer:
			push pointer 0 =
				@THIS // push pointer 1 will use @THAT
				D=M
				.. repeat starting at @sp from push constant
		temp:
			push temp 2 =
				@R7 // 7 comes from 5 + offset (offset is 2 here)
				D=M
				.. repeat starting at @sp from push constant
			
	iii.
		arg:
			push arg 3 =
				@ARG
				D=M
				@3
				A=D+A
				D=M
				.. repeat starting at @sp from push constant

	pop only applies to i and ii
	ii. Pop
		temp:
			pop temp 2 =
				@sp
				AM=M-1
				D=M
				@R7 // pointer and static will only be different on this line
				M=D
	iii. Pop
		local
			pop local 5
				// compute address
				@LCL // just change to THIS, THAT, and ARG for the others.
				D=M
				@5
				D=D+A // read this as "local plus 5"
				@R15 // temporary location
				M=D
				// now pop value off stack
				@sp
				AM=M-1
				D=M
				// get address
				@R15
				A=M
				// bring it all together
				M=D
