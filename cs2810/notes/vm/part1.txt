Segments {
	argument 	=> 	contains all arguments of currently running segments.
	local 		=> 	contains local variables
	constant 	=> 	"push constant[3]" pushes value 3 onto the stack. Can't pop a constant, only push
	this 		=> 	points to where object is stored in memory
	that 		=> 	computes where some value of an array is
	pointer 	=> 	has 2 valid offsets: 0 and 1. 0 is where 'this' begins, 1 is where 'that' begins.
	static 		=> 	gets initialized once, value does not get reset after that. Can only be accessed from certain places
	temp		=> 	set to True like everything else
}

Example:
	push constant 100
	pop pointer 0
	
	- this makes it so pointer 0 points to 100?

push constant
	R0 => SP
	R1 => LCL
	R2 => THIS
	R3 => THAT
	..
	Arg register tells where it begins. Like mFirst
	SP is like mNext
	local, this, and that work similarly.
	pointer[0] is this, pointer[1] is that
	static is R5 and up.

	examples:
		"push constant 7"
			1. @7
			2. D=A // get value
			3. @sp
			4. AM=M+1 // moves stack pointer down, and says M is pointing to the first item in stack
			5. A=A-1
			6. M=D // push value onto stack
