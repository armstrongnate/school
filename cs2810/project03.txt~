// Project 03

Combining combinational logic with sequential logic.

The clock:
	Cycle is from load high and back. (tick, tock)
	Harness a "digital flip flop" (DFF)
		outputs the input of one cycle ago. ex: out(t) = in(t-1)
	
Create a bit
	A DFF remembers and forgets a value with every clock cycle
	A bit can remember a value for as long as you want.
	
	if load(t-1) then out(t)=in(t-1)
	else out(t)=out(t-1)

	Take a DFF, and combine it with a Mux. (View slides online)

W-Bit Register "Word"??
	16 bits strung together

RAM8
	8 Words
	8 registers, multiplexors, and demultiplexors.

	in goes straight into the 8 registers	
	load get demuxed before going into the 8 registers
	then output of registers get put into a mux.
	see notebook

RAM64
	8 RAM8's put together same as RAM8 but use RAM8's instead of registers.

RAM16k
	4WayMuxes instead of 8Way which will be used in RAM4k?
