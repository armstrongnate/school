The Hack Computer
	16 bit computer - everything is 16 bits. No bytes. 
	Data memory (RAM) - just a bunch of 16 bit words
	Instruction memory (ROM) - read only. Separate from RAM to simplify.
	Registers: Data (D), Address (A). You can reference M.
		put the address where you want to store a value in A, put the value in M.
	
	A-instruction
		must be non-negative
		@17 	// A = 17
		D = A 	// D= 17
		
	C-instruction
		dest = comp; jump; // computation is not optional
		jump = jumps to current location in A.

	examples:
		set A to 17 => @17

		set D to A-1 => D = A-1

		set both A and D to A+1 => AD = A+1

		set D to 19 => 	@19
						D = A

		set both A and D to A+D => AD = D+A

		set RAM[5034] to D-1 => @5034
								M = D-1

		set RAM[53] to 171 => 	@171
								D = A
								@53
								M = D

		Add 1 to RAM[7], and store the result in D => 	@7
														MD = M+1

	more examples:
		GOTO 50 =>
			@50
			0; JMP

		IF D = 0 GOTO 112 =>
			@112
			D; JEQ

		IF D < 9 GOTO 507 =>
			@9
			D = D-A
			@507
			D;JLT

		IF RAM[12] > 0 GOTO 50 =>
			@12
			D=M
			@50
			D;JGT
