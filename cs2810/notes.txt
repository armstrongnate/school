## DAY 2 ##

Multiplexor
	takes 2 inputs and picks one of them to be the output. 
	uses a selector
		when selector is 0, output = a
		when selector is 1, outpus = b
	building one:
		NOT Selector AND a = True
		Selector AND b = True

Demultiplexor
	opposite of muliplexor
	get true to b
		Nand?
	get a
		in AND NOT Selector

Multi-bit chips
	Not16
	And16
	Or16
	Mux16
	These are just 16 of themselves bundled up.

	in[16]
	out[16]

	Not(in=in[0], out=out[0]);
	
	get one chip from bus => in[9]

Multi-way chips
	8WayOr Gate
		- chip with smallest wires wins the race.
	
	Mux4Way
XOr example
	CHIP Xor {

	IN a, b;
	OUT out;

	Parts:
		Or(a=a, b=b, out=either);
		Nand(a=a, b=b, out=notboth);
		And(a=either, b=notboth, out=out);
	}
