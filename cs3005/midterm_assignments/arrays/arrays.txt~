// Arrays

- Not resizable. You declare the size when you declare the array. 

int distance[10]; /* this is how you declare an array. The '10' can be a const 	variable. */

- limited in the length you can make an array.

- indexing of arrays is the same as python.

- no way to find length. Assign the length to a variable after declaration.

- initialize items of an array at declaration:

	int distance[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }

Array as a parameter:
	int largest_distance(int distance[], int size)
	{
		// code
	}

	- if you hard code 'distance[10]' in the params, you're limiting yourself to only ever passing an array of length ten into that function.
