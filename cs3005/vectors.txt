// vectors
// again, example file available online
/* 	
	* vectors are similar to lists
	* std::vector<int> my_ints; says the vector is expected to hold integers.
	* push_back() is equivelant to append
	* size() (ex: v.size) gets size of vector
*/

run ./vectors to see how to sort largest to smallest!
