OpenGL starter code:
  Change title
  glutDisplayFunc(display) is telling OpenGL what function to call when display changes.
  glutMainLoop() tells it to go to work.

  glColor3d() is our way of picking up a pen with a particular color. We use that pen until we pick up another one.
  
  DrawRectangle() draws a rectangle based on (1) bottom-left corner and (2) top-right corner.

  Window coordinates: (0,0) is bottom left corner.
  
  Mouse coordinates start from top-left.
    Include this code in mouse()
      int xdisplay = x;
      int ydisplay = screen_y -y;

    - get which mode you're in
    - store points as user clicks
    - once enough points are collected based on mode, draw shape
    
  InitializeMyState()
    setup empty lists (mouse_clicks, etc.)

  ** Get starter code downloaded and running before Wednesday. Start on defining new classes. **

** Second step:
make a global that is a vector of shapes
  std::vector<shape*> shapes;
  
display()
  for loop over shapes
    for each shape
      call draw
  
initialize my stuff
  shapes.push_back a new rectangle()
  same for triangle and circle

virtual void draw() = 0;

include cmath
  sqrt and pow functions
