quiz the user on powers of two from 1-50.

2^7 ?? user inputs 128. If correct, ask another question, if incorrect, ask the same question.

Time how long it took the user to do all 50 questions.
	int t1 = std::time(0);

	// code

	int t2 = std::time(0);
	int dt = t2-t1

2^23 ?? 8192k or 8m are both good answers.

char num[16];
char suffix[k];

// some code

int v = std::atoi(num);

if suffix[0] == 'k';
	v *= 1024;
else if suffix is m
	v *= 1024 * 1024;
and so on..

string compare:
	std::strcmp(suffix, "mega") 
		returns 0 if equal.
	wont have to do this for this assignment.

USE LONG INT! see bits.cpp
