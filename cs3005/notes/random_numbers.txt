// random numbers
// we have to manually "seed" our random numbers (find a starting point).
// pay attention to includes

std::srand( time(0) ); // seed. Only do this once.

r = (std::rand() % 100) + 1 // gets a random number between 1 and 100

d = std::rand() % 6 + 1 // gets random number between 1 and 6.
