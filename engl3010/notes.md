#### Research

* you should know a little about the subject
* it should be familiar
* it should be interesting
* not part of the finished product

#### Planning

* audience and how they will be receptive to ideas
* don't start immediately after research, have some time inbetween

#### Drafting

* safety in knowing it can change
* don't be negative, find out what works first
* take time, give yourself breaks, refocus
* just write, don't think

#### Revising

* most important part, make or break

#### Editing

* get to the point faster

### Collaboration

Collaborating on work writing should be very beneficial but sometimes it is not.

#### Common problems

1. Lack of people being constructive
2. Lack of people participating
3. Lack of moving the group forward

#### Computers

Computer-supported collaboration elliminates excuses. You can always send off an email.

#### Meetings

Meetings are either really good or really bad.

#### Other problems with group work

* power struggles
* relying on others (being on the same pace)

#### Resolving problems

* communicate
* focus on your goal

### Summary

* Writing takes time
* Writing is a process
* Business writing is not always completed in a bubble
* Put away your ego
