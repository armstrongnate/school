### Planning quiz review

There will be a quiz (next time?) on the Planning section. Questions will
have you name and possibly describe 5 things from the following sections.

#### Estimation
1. Cocomo
2. Competitive pricing
3. Previous projects
4. Cost analysis
5. Market

#### Mythical Man Month
1. Adding programmers late is bad
2. No silver bullet - no such thing as a tool that solves everything
3. Conceptual integrity - vision is understood by all members of the team
4. No such thing as a man month
5. In-house vs client work - client work is 3 times more expensive
6. Tar pit - don't get in over your head, go after the sizable projects
7. Second-system effect - second system will be the worst one you ever design because
you try to cram everything in
8. Progress tracking is detrimental to a project's success
9. Pilot system - a throwaway system for working out the kinks
10. Communication - there should be **a lot** of communication channels


#### Case of the Killer Robot
TODO: What are 5 things that can go wrong with software development?

#### CMMI Processes
Level | Name | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
0 | Undefined | unproven
1 | Initial | white horse / batman
2 | Managed | team
3 | Defined | team of teams
4 | Quantitative | statistics
5 | Optimzing | using collected statistics

#### SCRUM and Sprint
TODO: look it up and make sure you can explain what it is

#### GANT Chart
Given a table, make a chart. Look at prerequisites and line up the blocks.

### Test Review

Test is on Thursday.

#### IDEs and Text Editors

IDEs:

* Xcode
* Android Studio
* Eclipse

Text editors:

* Atom
* Sublime Text
* Vim
* Emacs

#### Coding

* comments (1 for every 10 lines)
* variable names (underscores are hard)
* DRY (this is a ruby thing)
* avoid pointers
* avoid arrays

#### Testing

##### 1. White box
You can see the code and can perform fence post conditions.

##### 2. Black box
This is the `double` function. You can't see the code.

##### 3. Gray box
You have a pretty good idea of what the code looks like.

##### 4. Oracle
Everyday at 4:00 everyone submits their code and it gets tested over night.

##### 5. Mothra
Godzilla had a baby that spit out deviants of itself. Morphing your code and every
morph should break your code.

##### 6. Code review
Make sure your buddy's code is correct. Hurt the code not the programmer. Break
review sessions up into 30 minute increments.

##### 7. Acceptance
Client testing.

##### 8. Destructive
Run it until it breaks.

##### 9. UX Testing
Bob's niece is a ux tester. Pay someone to tell you if your ux sucks in a 30-40
page report.

##### 10. Alpha/Beta/GOLD testing
Alpha: programmer testing

Beta: user testing

GOLD: send it to the publisher

##### 11. Stress
Try it with more data, users, etc.

##### 12. Smoke
Focus testing on areas that are the most complex or mostly being used in order
to save testing time.
