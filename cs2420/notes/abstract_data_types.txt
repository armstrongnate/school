# Abstract Data Types

STACK
	push
	pop
	top
	isEmpty()
	init

QUEUE
	enqueue (put on in)
	dequeue (take one out)
	front (look at the one in front)
	isEmpty
	init

	python list doesn't work good with a queue. use a link list?

CONTAINERS
	Unordered
		order does not matter
	User Ordered
		where everything is is very important. User says "put this is in position 7."
	Auto ordered
		program maintains order

	Class UnorderedUniqueContainer:
		init(self)
			self.mFirst = None
		Insert(self, object)
			n = Node(object, self.mFirst)
			self.mFirst = n
		Exists?(fakeObject)
		Delete(fakeObject)
		Retrieve(fakeObject)
		Traverse # get data based on all elements
			use a callBack function so everyone can get their hands on data.

Linked Lists
	class Node:
		def __init__(self, object, next):
			self.mObject = object
			self.mNext = next
