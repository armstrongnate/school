Due Part 1 due Friday, Part 2 Monday

create a class for Student with appropriate data members:
	last name
	first name
	SSN - slice out dashes and store it as an integer
	email
	age

DO NOT ALLOW DUPLICATES
	If SSN is the same, don't add but instead print out a message saying something is wacky.

import time. Time before, time after, subtract the two.

class Student:
	def __init__(self, words):
		self.mLast = words[0]
		self.mFirst = words[1]
		self.ssn = int(words[2][:3]+words[2][4:6]+words[2][7:])
		# to do: make ssn an integer by stripping out dashes, etc.
		self.mEmail = words[3]
		self.mAge = int(words[4])

	def __str__(self):
		s = self.mLast + ", " + self.mFirst
		return s

	def __eq__(self, rhs): 
		#rhs = right hand side. 
		# use this to compare two Student objects with the s1 == s2 notation.
		return self.mSSN == rhs.mSSN

	# TODO: write ne, lt, gt, le, ge


def main():

	# ===== Insert ===== #
	fin = open()
	for line in fin:
		words = line.split() # gets the 5 items in a list, each item at its own index.
		s = Student(words)
		# TODO: do something about duplicates.
		allStudents.append(s)

	# ===== Traverse ===== #
	totalAge = 0.0
	# should end up being 42.something
	for s in allStudnets:
		totalAge += s.getAge()
	print "The average age of all the students is %f" % (totalAge/len(allStudents))

	# ===== Delete ====== #
	# ssn = line.strip()

	# ===== Retrieve ===== #
	# totalAge should end up being 49.something
	# use count to keep track of how many were totally retrieved so you can divide by that number to find average.
