Program 2

4 different data sets:
	compares w/ sorted data
	compares w/ random data
	swapes w/ sorted data
	swapes w/ random data

def main():
	useRandom = True
	useCompares = False
	startingSize = 8
	endingSize = 4096
	sys.setrecursionlimit(endingSize+10)

	size = startingSize
	while size <= endingSize

	# create list (A) that we will sort depending on random or sorted

	# make a copy of A for each sorting algorithms

	# call each algorithms, those algorithms should return compares/swaps

	# print out log of number of compares/swaps.

	if useCompares
		print compares
	else:
		print swaps

	size *= 2

x = math.log(x)/math.log(2) # takes log base 2 of log.
x *= 100
x = int(x)
x = float(x)
x /= 100

7 sorting algorithms, 8 columns because first column has no label.
