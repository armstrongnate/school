# ML

Not an imperative language.

Statement: do something

Expression: way of evaluating something

An `if` expression can be reused.

_Referencial transparency_ is kind of like caching the expression since it will
always have the same output given the same inputs.

_Value bindings_ are not variables because they can't change.

**TODO** have a usable ML installation by next time.
